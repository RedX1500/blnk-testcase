Super user: redd – password: 123
Provider: provider – passwrord: potatotomato
Customer: customer – password: potatotomato
Bank Personnel: bankemp – password: potatotomato

P.S. I made all passwords the same for easy testing

I made the app so that first the provider needs to add a fund to the database using his own page after logging in into the system, then the bank personnel will apply the settings to the loan using his own page after logging using his own different username and password, then the customer does the same thing and logs in and they can choose which fund they will apply for and entering their own loan term and the amount they are requesting. 

The admin however can view all can access all available pages on the site. But each other type of user can only access the page related to their role.

For me to be able to apply the role system to the site I used ABSTRACRUSER to add the role field. 
However preferably only the admin can assign each role for each user, but I also did it like this for ease of testing the system.
Multiple changes can be applied to the site to make it both more efficient and more user friendly
